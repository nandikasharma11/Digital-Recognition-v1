# Digital-Recognition-v1
Handwritten Digit Recognition uses a CNN trained on the MNIST dataset to identify digits (0–9). A Tkinter GUI lets users draw a digit, which is preprocessed and sent to the model for real‑time prediction. The project demonstrates deep learning and basic computer‑vision concepts.
